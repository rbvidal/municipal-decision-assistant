# ADR-018 — Provenance-Aware Knowledge Graph

## Status

Accepted. Implemented in `platform-neo4j/src/main/java/com/cognitera/platform/neo4j/model/GraphNode.NodeProvenance`.

## Context

Knowledge graphs generated from AI extraction are only trustworthy if every node and edge can be traced back to its source. Without provenance, a graph node claiming "Acme Corporation is an ORGANIZATION" cannot be audited — was this extracted from a financial report or hallucinated by an LLM?

## Decision

Every graph node and relationship carries **`NodeProvenance`**:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `sourceDocumentId` | Which document was the source |
| `chunkId` | Which chunk within the document |
| `chunkOffset` | Position within the chunk |
| `extractionConfidence` | How confident was the extraction (0.0–1.0) |
| `extractionTimestamp` | When was it extracted |
| `extractionModel` | Which model performed the extraction |
| `promptVersion` | Which prompt template version was used |
| `provider` | Which AI provider performed the extraction |

Provenance is captured during enrichment (`DefaultEnrichmentService`), bridged through `EnrichmentHook`, and persisted to Neo4j by `GraphEnrichmentService`. The data flows: `EnrichmentContext` → `EnrichmentResult` → `GraphNode` (with `NodeProvenance`) → Neo4j.

## Alternatives Considered

- **No provenance**: Rejected. An unauditable knowledge graph is useless for enterprise applications.
- **Separate provenance table in PostgreSQL**: Rejected. Graph data should carry its own provenance. A separate store creates consistency challenges.
- **Blockchain-based provenance**: Rejected. Over-engineered. Immutable audit log in PostgreSQL + provenance in Neo4j provides sufficient traceability.

## Consequences

- **Full traceability**: Every graph element can be traced to its source document, chunk, model, prompt, and provider
- **Confidence-aware**: Extraction confidence enables filtering low-confidence extractions
- **Reproducibility**: Re-extraction with different models/prompts can be compared by timestamp and version

## Trade-offs

- Provenance adds storage overhead to every node and relationship
- `extractionConfidence` is self-reported by the extraction method (not independently verified)
- Provenance is not yet leveraged for retrieval scoring (e.g., boost high-confidence extractions)

## Future Evolution

- Confidence-weighted retrieval: boost documents with high-confidence extractions
- Provenance visualization in the UI
- Automated re-extraction when prompt version changes
- Provenance chain: "entity A was extracted from chunk B of document C by model D using prompt E at time F"
